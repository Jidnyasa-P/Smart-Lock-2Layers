# Smart-Lock-2Layers

This project is derived from our original project "Smart-Lock". But the main feature is that it adds two layers of security. It is very useful in cases where important documents are stored or in a bank locker where money is stored, because these need more security & protection.

Working of our code:-

1.  The user needs to enter the passcode.
2.  If the passcode is correct (in any of 3 attempts) 3 security questions will be asked. Each question has 3 attempts.
    i) If the user answers all the questions correctly then the door will be opened.
    ii) If the user fails to answer any of the threee questions then the door will be locked and the security will be called.
3.  If the passcode is incorrect (in all of the 3 attempts).The door will be locked and the security will be called.
